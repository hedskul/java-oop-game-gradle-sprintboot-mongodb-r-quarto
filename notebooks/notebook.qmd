Principles of Object-Oriented Design

Divide-and-Conquer Principle. Generally, we will divide solutions to
problems into sets of interacting objects, each with its own specialized
tasks,

Encapsulation Principle. Each object will encapsulate the expertise,
attributes and actions that it needs to carry out its role in the
solution.

Interface Principle. Each object will present an interface to the other
objects that will limit the way they interact with each other.

Information Hiding Principle. Objects will be designed to hide certain
information and implementation details from other objects.

Generality Principle. Objects will be designed as generally as possible.
So that rather than solving only a particular problem, they can solve
similar problems of the same kind.

Extensibility Principle. Objects will be designed so that they can
potentially be extended to perform related tasks.

Abstraction Principle. The objects we design will be abstractions
because they will ignore many of the attributes and actions that
characterize the real objects they represent. They will include only 
those attributes and behaviors needed to solve a particular problem.
